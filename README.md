# MIPS-Assembly
Some experiments with an simplified MIPS Assembly.

## Simplified Assembly
In these exemples we will only use 10 MIPS instructions:

**Type R:** add, sub, slt, and, or.\
**Type I:** addi, lw, sw, beq.\
**Type J:** j.

## Test and Run
To assist in the development and testing of the application you can use the simulator available [HERE](http://www.ic.uff.br/~fernanda/SimuladorFAC). It has all the necessary features for the machine and has an assembler to simplify the loading of the program.\
This simulator was developed by Professor Diego Passos - Universidade Federal Fluminense.
